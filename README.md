# RecruitmentTasks_OrderComment


## Features
Magento 2 module that adds special configurable comment to order by queue.

## Installation
Create proper folders code/RecruitmentTasks/OrderComment then copy module files inside.

## Posible TODOS
- defining amqp connection type is not required in xml files, we can and even should skip it if we are using only one connection in env.php it will be easier to switch into db (temporary, from experience) if somerthing goes wrong with rabbit, 
- I'm not 100% sure if "special comment order" is "Notes for this Order" in admin, just to be clear if this will be a standard task that will be easy to find,
